            <p>Using housing data from Ames, Iowa I was able to create a model that predicted housing prices when given features of a house. I had to spend hours cleaning the data and account for positive outliers in the dataset.Overall my model had an R-squared score of .9310 which means my model accurately predicted ~93 percent of the changes in housing price. This is remarkably accurate when you think about all the neighborhood and housing features that impact how much a house will sell for. In the future I would hope to see if I could expand upon this model to predict housing prices in other cities.

            <p>Using reddit comments and posts talking about the shows Seinfeld and Curb you Enthusiasm I was able to use Natural Language Processing techniques to categorize the posts. I first used reddit's API to pull in the posts and comments from the two shows and by using the API I was able to pull in thousands of posts and comments from each show. I then cleaned my data by getting rid of all instances of websites and non-alphabetical characters as these characters didn't help in predicting which show the post was about. To predict the show I used a number of methods to break apart the words and determine the show. I first used count vectorizer and logistic regression as the base model and was able to get an 86 percent accuracy score on my testing data, which is significantly higher than my 50 percent baseline score. I was able to increase my accuracy by using the TFIDF Vectorizer and Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forest models and was able to get accuracy scores of 90 and 88 percent.

          <h2 class="mb-5">Measuring the Economic Impact of Natural Disasters</h2>

              <p>I was tasked with finding if there is any sort of negative relationship with instances of natural disasters and how successful a cities economy does. For this project my team and I decided to study the affect Hurricane Sandy had on local wages and unemployment statistics in 10 different cities along the east coast shore. We collected a number of different weather statistics to measure how severly the storm hit the city and found monthly unemployment statistics for wage and unemployment for each city.

                I wanted to use a time series model to model the data because I had historical data. Because natural disasters occur suddenly, I was trying to assess the sudden fluctuations in the economic data that may have occurred in the months following Hurricane Sandy, which occurred in October 2012. That means that, in the context of ARIMA modeling, I was interested in extracting the moving average component of this data (which handles sudden fluctuations), and ignoring the auto-regressive component of this data (which handles long-term trends). Because I had obvious seasonality in this data, I took one order of seasonal differencing (12 months) before fitting the models.

                In general, I did not see any obvious fluctuation in the moving average wages for any locality and for any industry.As opposed to wages, I saw a small uptick in unemployment at the beginning of 2013 that may potentially be attributed to Hurricane Sandy, but it is not a large enough increase for me to make any meaningful conclusions.

              <p>I was interested to see if I could create a credit card fraud detection model to detect instances of fraud. I was able to find a dataset that had around 285,000 fraud purchase points that had fraud and non-fraud charges. Each charge had the amount of the purchase as well as historic information on the card holders’ patterns. I knew for this model I wanted to minimize instances where the charge was fraudulent, but I predicted it was not fraud, so I optimized my model based on the recall score. I tried multiple different models and it turned that the random forest model scored the best with a perfect recall score of 1.0 and an accuracy score of over 99 percent. I also created a Bayesian logistic regression model which was helpful because it could allow me to see the distribution for each of my coefficients.
